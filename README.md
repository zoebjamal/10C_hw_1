Hw 1 for PIC 10C

The objective for this assignment is to effectively use version control for a project. The project I have elected to create is a simple game in which a player needs to slay monsters.


Progress:
  - Small hiccup when trying to create merge conflict - will read more about them and try again
  - update: was able to successfully create merge conflict and resolved it
